<h1> Martina's Design Document</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Goals</strong> The goal of the website is to provide information our non-profit organization, <em>Team Koka</em>. Users can find information on <em>Team Koka</em>, such as: how we were formed, how to register for upcoming events, vidoes and photos of past events, how to contribute or volunteer at an event, different causes we support, and contact information.</li>
    <li><strong>Why People Would Visit My Website</strong>As an organization, we get the same questions through our Facebook page and other social media accounts. This website will be a place for us to provide a bulk of information so users can access it there instead of asking us directly. It would also make it easier for us to respond to the questions because we would be able to direct them to the page, instead of answering each message.</li>
    <li><strong>What People Can Gain from My Website</strong> On this website, I will try and provide as much information as possible. They would gain access to the information they usually inquire about. They will be able to view events, past and present, and see how they can get involved with our organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Questions Asked</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Why would you want to access this website?</li>
    <li>What information do you expect to see?</li>
    <li>How would you use this information?</li>
    <li>What suggestions would you like to include for this website?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use Case</h2>
<p>Here are some examples of why users benefit from using the website.</p>
<ol>
    <li>A student at Tinian Jr. Sr. High School wants to volunteer for <em>Team Koka</em> to earn service hours for her senior portfolio requirement. The student could go to the website to find out how she can volunteer.</li>
    <li>A staffer at the Mayor's Office wants to know how their office can contribute to the events, whether monetary or supplies. They would also like to include the upcoming events on the community calendar. The staffer can access the site to see all upcoming events and ways to contribute or donate.</li>
    <li>A family member who lives off-island wants to see how they can donate school supplies to our Back-2-School Drive. The family member can see the address to send the supplies to.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to get the input from people who were active in the community such as high school students looking to volunteer and people who worked for the local government who could provide support. I also decided to get input from someone who lived off-island because when we held the relief drives for Super Typhoon Yutu, which devastated our islands in October, they wanted to find out how they could contribute to the relief drive.</p>
<h2>Design Concept</h2>
<h3>Audience</h3>
The website is being created for anyone who wants to volunteer for, participate in, or contribute to the <em>Team Koka</em>events. There is no specific age range or gender. The audience would people living on Tinian, but I will also have some information for people who are living abroad, which will likely be contact information.
<h3>Reference Websites</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/">Autism Speaks</a> At the top of this website, the following links are provided: What is Autism?, Help and Information, Our Work, Get Involved and Donate. A user can access information to see what work they have done and how they can donate to the cause.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.rmhc.org/">Ronald McDonald House Charities</a>This website uses graphics particularly well. They are large and catch the user's attention, but they are also informational. There is a blue graphic in the middle of the page that highlights what the organization does. At the top of the page, there are pictures of those they have supported or helped. Users can see the impact of what the organization does, which will hopefully make them want to volunteer or support events.</li> 
    <li><a href="https://www.redcross.org/">American Red Cross</a> American Red Cross' priority seems to be getting donations for blood, as it is the first thing that appears when you open their page. If we needed volunteers for our events, I would try and highlight this on my page.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.girlscouts.org/">Girl Scouts of America</a> When I opened the Girl Scouts of America webpage, a feedback window popped up, which I would like to add one day, but I feel it might be a bit too advance for this class. On the home page is a picture of a young girl, which sparks empowerment. An image like this would hopefully spark interest in volunteering or participating.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.whoirun4.com/">IR4</a>As soon as you open the web page, a video of a runner starts playing. This website uses the visual very well, giving users an idea of what kind of events the charity supports.</li> 
</ul>
<h2>Presentation Information</h2>
<h3>Content Sypnopsis</h3>
For my website, I would like to present the information similar to how most of the other organizations present it. They use lots of visuals, so I will use pictures. I would also like to include the other information in a navigation bar at the top of the page, where it will be the most accessible. I probably won't make the page itself too long. Most of the websites I browsed only had users scrolling for a short time.
<h3>Text Outline</h3>
Here are different pages I plan to include:
<ul>
    <li>Home Page - This page will include a few pictures and a navigation bar at the top of the page. The navigation bar will give the user access to each link listed below.</li> 
    <li>About Us - This page will include information on how the organization was formed and what its purpose is.</li> 
    <li>Events - This page will include either an embedded calendar or list of upcoming events and how to participate.</li> 
    <li>How to Get Involved - This page will include ways to get involved and to contribute.</li> 
    <li>Contact Information - This page will include contact information. Contact information will also be located at the bottom of the home page.</li> 
</ul>
<h3>Wireframe</h3>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
I wanted my website to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, so I didn't put too many links on the home page. I also didn't want to include too much information, realizing this after I had created the layout. The home page will be simple, with the navigation bar at the top of the page and contact information at the bottom of the page. I wanted to include the detailed information on the sub pages. Because my website is fairly easy to navigate, I will that my audience of all ages would be able to access the website wihtout any issues. The way I organized the pages was based on the way most of the other organizations organized their pages. They included the basic information in links at the top of the page.
<h3>Media</h3>
Since we make it a point to document our events through pictures, getting the media for this page will not be a problem. I already have an array of pictures to choose from. 
I will mostly be including pictures of events so that people can see what events we host. I will also be included the logo for the organization.
All images will be credited to <em>Team Koka</em>, since it will be organizations photos I will be using. We also include a photo release/waiver for each of our events.
<h3>Color Scheme</h3>
The color scheme I chose are the main colors we use for the events, which are <span style="color: #c05aee;"><strong>purple</strong></span> and <span style="color:#28bdc9;"><strong>teal</strong></span>. I guess the best way to describe it would be tradic. The background will either be black or white, depending on which will be easier to read.
