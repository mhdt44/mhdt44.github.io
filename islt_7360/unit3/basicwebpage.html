<h1>Martina's Basic Webpage</h1>

<p>For this project, I'm going to focus on a non-profit organization called <em>Team Koka</em>. 
<blockquote>Team Koka was founded in 2012 by my sisters and I. We wanted to start a non-profit organization to host events in our community that promoted awareness of the different disabilities in our community. </blockquote>
<h2>Topic #1</h2>

<p> For topic #1, I will discuss the purpose of Team Koka and how we were created. I'll also discuss the <strong>motivation</strong> behind forming the organization.
I will also discuss and post pictures of the different events we have hosted. I would like to include different ways people could get involved and perhaps include a list of other community organizations they could get involved with as well.</p>

<h2> Topic #2</h2>
<p>For topic #2, I will discuss the following:</p>

<h3>Upcoming Events</h3>

<ul>
<li>Back to School Drive - (August) The back to school drive donations will go to students who are in need of school supplies.</li>
<li>Ball4MD - (September) Usually held in September, Ball4MD is a basketball tournament held to spread awareness of Muscular Dystrophy.</li>
<li>Glow Walk, Run, Wheel - (December) The Glow Walk, Run, Wheel is an annual event and the route for the walk is Tinian's first-ever wheelchair-accesible route.</li>
<li>International Day of Acceptance - (January) Throughout the month of January, we sell ribbons for $1. Each ribbon represents a different kind of disability.</li>
