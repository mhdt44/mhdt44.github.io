<h1> Martina's Website Evaluation</h1>
<h2>Evaluator Participants</h2>
<p>The first evaluator participant I got a response from is Marquina Hofschneider, a native of Tinian and a graduate student at Oregon State University. Marquina has assisted us with <em>Team Koka</em> events in the past through volunteering and contributions. She also asks as somewhat of a liason to our supporters in Oregon. Marquina has helped us coordinated relief drives, so I thought she would be a good person to review the website. She used a PC running Windows 10 and Google Chrome (Version 75).</p>
<p>The second evaluator participant is Odorico San Nicolas. Odorico is a former student of Tinian High School and volunteered many hours with <em>Team Koka</em>. I felt Odorico would be a good participant because he would test one of my use cases of a student who is looking for hours. Odorico use a Macbook Air running Mojave and Google Chrome for the browser.</p>
<p>Just a note: I am still waiting for at least one more response to update this page and re-submit the assignment.</p>
<h2>Summary of Evaluator's Comments</h2>
<p>Marquina rated two of  elements with a low score: the lack of multimedia on the page and the in-depth content on the site. Odorico commented on the overall organization and felt the information was too cluttered at the top of the page and spacing on some of the tabs. He also commented on the lack of multimedia on the page, as well as the information that would allow for reflection. </p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>I believe I was able to meet the needs of my use cases; however, I feel that I still need to add more information. For example, Odorico commented on the redundancy of the contact information, but I thought it was a good thing because the user can access the same information on different pages. Overall, both users said the website was easy to navigate, which was my goal. What I would like to work on for my final site is to add the information that is more in-depth. The information was there for all three of my use cases, but based on my evaluators' ratings, the inforomation wasn't there and more could be included. Because the site is simple and easy to navigate, it would be fairly easy for them to find this information. By the end of the final project, I should be able to meet all three user cases. I didn't consider abandoning any part of the site because it would be fairly easy to add the information. </p>
<h2>Recommended/Planned changes to design</h2>
<p>Based on the ratings provided by my evaluators, the two changes I will be making are adding multimedia to the site and adding more in-depth content. These were the two things they both gave a low score for and/or commented on. One of the elements discussed in the design document was the use of visuals to showcase the different events that <em>Team Koka</em> hosts and I didn't include that at all in the pilot website. It would improve the site to give some visuals to the user so they can see our volunteers and participants in action. One of the recommendations I will not be considering is changing the color scheme. My classmsates and the other evaluator seemed to like the color scheme (and they are also <em>Teak Koka</em>'s colors so I will go ahead and keep them. I may change the tone or brightness to make it a bit easier to read.</p>
<h2>Reflection on evaluation process</h2>
<p>I appreciate the types of evaluations conducted in this course. First, we had to post our links to a discussion board to seek comments from our peers who are taking the class. I thought this was helpful because they are all familiar with what we have been working on, so they could make specific comments on what elements and attributes we could use to make the site better. The evaluator form was also very helpful because it asked for ratings on each section, as well as comments for each element. This was helpful for me because I am able to get a sense of what the experience would be like for some of my user cases. I definitely appreciated the specific comments provided by the evaluators and my classmates. I've learned that it's important to get feedback from different perspectives (those in and out of class) because one group may not catch what the other group will. They definitely picked up on elements that I didn't.</p>
