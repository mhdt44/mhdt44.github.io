    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <main>
    <p>Being a graduate student at Mizzou through the Learning Technologies and Design program has been a great experience. There are many skills that I have learned and I expect to use in my professional career. I have gained experienced in each of the core competencies emphasized in this program. </p>
 
    <h3>Core Competencies of the University of Missouri Learning Technologies and Design</h3>
    <p class="indent">To practice first core competency, <strong>Design and Development of learning systems</strong>, my classes allowed me to conduct research on the different areas of learning technologies and design. I learned about the different systems of instructional design and used rapid tools to design learning. I explored Canvas as an instructor and learned the importance of web design and development. The second core competency, <strong>Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation</strong>, was demonstrated through evaluations of the learning systems in all of my classes using a very hands-on process. This allowed me to test my learning systems with different users. Lastly, in order to practice <strong>Leadership and Social Responsibility</strong>, I was able to interact with my peers respectfully through discussion boards and video conferencing. In my research course, I learned the importance of following a code of ethics. In my digital media course, we demonstrated the importance of giving credit to the owners of any digital media that we use.</p>
