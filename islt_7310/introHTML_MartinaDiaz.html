Hafa Adai and Tirow! My name is Martina Diaz and I am from a small island in the Pacific Ocean called Tinian, which is a part of the Northern Marianas island chain. Our island is located approximately 100 miles from Guam. I am a Vice-Principal at Tinian Jr. Sr. High School, where I taught high school English for five and a half years before becoming an administrator. I have a Bachelor of Arts in English from Oregon State University and I am currently in the third term of the Learning Design and Technologies program here at Mizzou. Before this course, I took Intro to Web Development as a pre-requisite, but thatâ€™s pretty much the experience I have! In this course, I expect we will go more in depth with web development and coding. I hope to apply the skills that I learn in this course in my current occupation, or perhaps even as a hobby on the side. In my free time, I like to read, play Magic the Gathering, go to the beach or engage in physical activities. I look forward to getting to know all of you!
