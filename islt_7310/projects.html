    <h1>Audio Clip</h1>
        <p>This audio clip is a small part of a learning experience that I designed for my digital media course. Our task was to create a lesson that incorporated media in the learning experience. In this particular clip, I am explaining one of the components of digital citizenship. To create this audio clip, I used an Adobe Audition to arrange the audio and add background music. I used a media-hosting website called Clyp to host my audio. The audio clip is short, but informative, so it works well with the lesson I was creating, with the overall goal being to introduce students to the nine components of digital citizenship. To improve the clip, I would become more familiar with the features of Adobe Audition so I could make the voice over sound clearer. </p>

    <h1>Video</h1>
        <p>This video is another small section of the same learning experience for my digital media course. For this assignment, we first had to study different aspects of filming, including the different types of angles and shots, as well as editing and filming strategies. I shot all the footage and completed all the editing myself, using iMovie. The video clip describes one of the components of digital citizenship. Personally, I would say this is the project I am most proud of because I was satisfied with the outcome, given the amount of time we had to work on the project (approximately one week). To improve the project, I would incorporate more people in the video. I would use a better microphone to record the voiceover. I would say the strengths of this project are the variety of shots and angles included in such a short video.</p>

    <h1>Learning Experience</h1>
        <p>For this project, we had to create a learning experience, while incorporating different types of digital media. I chose to do a simple introductory lesson on the components of digital citizenship. The lesson begins with the objectives that students will master at the end of the lesson, as well as instructions on how to navigate the lesson. Then, the lesson incorporates three types of digital media experiences: image, audio, and video. After interacting with each component, students answer questions. This has also been one of my favorite projects to work on, especially because I had to create most of the components from scratch. </p>
