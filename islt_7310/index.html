        <h3>About Me</h3>
    
        Hafa Adai and Tirow! Welcome to my portfolio.<br>
        <p>Degrees and Programs:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Bachelor of Arts in English, Oregon State University</li>
        <li>Master of Science in Learning Technologies and Design, University of Missouri, Columbia</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am expected to complete this program in December 2020. The goals of this program are to help students learn “knowledge and skills in required to design learning systems and develop digital media and network applications.” Each student in this program is required to create a portfolio as a part of the graduation requirement. The portfolio should showcase the student’s learning in the program.</p>
